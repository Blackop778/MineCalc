# MineCalc
A forge mod that will introduce a calculator in the game. It is for version 1.7.10.
##Developing
Run `Setup-eclipse.bat` to set up the workspace for eclipse. Then open your preferred eclipse workspace, go to `Import`, `General`, `Existing Projects into Workspace`, finally select `MineCalc` as your root directory and hit `Finish`.
Running `Build.bat` will build MineCalc into a .jar a normal forge installation can run. `runClient.bat` and `runServer.bat` will open a minecraft client/server with MineCalc installed.
##To-do
- Add server console integration
